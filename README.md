# pokeCatchDeployment

My first deployed Mern app. Previous deployment was static and did not persist state, only local storage. 
this app was made to make a deploed project and build upon all of my previous struggles before diving into more
libraries and practices like useQuery, React Router, and writing higher quality code in my Bible Comentary App.
